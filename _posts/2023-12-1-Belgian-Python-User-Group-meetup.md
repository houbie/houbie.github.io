### Meetup hosted by BeCode in Li√®ge
It was a productive evening with 3 talks and a lot of interesting discussions.

For those who missed it, here are the slides of my talk about
a roadtrip [From Java to Python](https://www.slideshare.net/ivohoubrechts1/the-story-of-migrating-from-java-to-python).
